# Developers Tech Blog Theme

Custom theme for our tech blog based on [WriteFreely](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely).
Using Mustache, Rollup and its plugins we can import any external JS library and
style, write custom styles using Sass, get a minified theme and more..

## Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Run build

```
npm run build
```

The final theme will be available in `dist/output.html`.
